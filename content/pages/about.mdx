I'm a Content Creator, indie developer, and digital nomad.

I create content about **being a solopreneur and production-ready apps**. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thedevdavid), [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@thedevdavid), and [my blog](https://davidlevai.com/).

Since my teenage years, I have worked as a freelance full-stack developer mostly with startups and small businesses. In 2020 I decided to use this knowledge to scale a digital agency and try to build something for myself. **As of 2023, I'm building businesses in public, and helping developers become entrepreneurs.**

## What's the point of doing these in public?

- I believe you can learn a lot by following other people's journeys. I'm following a lot of other creators too.
- Through social media and public building, I get to meet interesting people and we can support each other.

While I'm away from the internet, I work out a lot and travel to see more and more of the world. _(Soon maybe another planet?)_

## What kind of stuff do you find here?

Videos, blogs, tips, and discussions. Learn how to build an international digital product agency, develop production-ready apps, and be mindful and productive as an IT entrepreneur.
