Full-stack Product Engineer building modern, production-ready apps for companies and myself.

Over the past decade, I've worked as a freelance full-stack developer mostly with startups and small businesses. In 2020 I decided to deepen my business and product knowledge, to build outstanding products.

As of now, I'm building production-ready products efficiently, and documenting my journey as a solopreneur product engineer. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thedevdavid), [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@thedevdavid), and [my blog](https://davidlevai.com/).

## Why building in public?

- Following other people's journeys can teach you a lot. As well as you, I follow many other creators.
- Being active on social media and building in public allowed me to be part of a club that prioritizes shipping and giving value.

## What's here?

Videos, tutorials, actionable tips & tricks about product engineering and solopreneurship.
