description: Quick way to check what I'm up to these days.

## Where am I?

I'm a digital nomad, but I'm not traveling much these days. I'm currently spending most of my time in Europe, living a habit-based life.

## What I'm working on currently?

1.  Building a shit-ton of free stuff on YouTube
2.  Mentoring developers to become solopreneurs
3.  Developing indie-projects [like this developer blogging platform](https://github.com/thedevdavid/digital-garden)

## I am available for:

- public speaking
- content collaboration

## Am I available for freelance work/employment/co-founding/gardening?

Currently, I'm **not** available for employment-based work. I'm only considering unique/exciting projects for freelance work or consulting.

For consulting I'm available maximum 3 days a week. My daily rate is $800.
For freelance projects, it depends on the requirements. Minimum project engagement is $25,000

### How do I decide about a project if it sounds exciting?

I follow the **"Hell yeah! or No"** principle.
