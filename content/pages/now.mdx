## Where am I?

I'm a digital nomad, but I'm not traveling much these days. I'm currently spending most of my time in Europe, living a habit-based life.

## What I'm working on currently?

1. Building indie products and documenting the process on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thedevdavid) & [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@thedevdavid)
2. Helping companies with product engineering
3. Mentoring developers to become solopreneurs
4. Developing open-source dev tools [like this developer blogging platform](https://github.com/thedevdavid/digital-garden)

## I am available for:

- public speaking
- content collaboration
- mentoring
- consulting & product engineering

## Am I available for freelance work/employment/co-founding/gardening?

Currently, I'm **not** available for employment-based work. However, **I'm happy to help with consulting or full-stack product engineering**.

**For consulting**: I'm available maximum 3 days a week. My daily rate is $800.

**For product engineering**: Minimum project engagement is $15,000 & 3 months.

### How do I decide about a project if it sounds exciting?

I follow the **"Hell yeah! or No"** principle.
